Suggested Tasks (Step-by-step)

Task 1: Setup Project and Basic Entities
	- Create Spring Boot project with dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, H2/MySQL).
	- Define UsersEntity and StudentsEntity with fields above.
	- Setup database connection and JPA repositories.

Task 2: User Registration and Authentication
	- Implement /api/register endpoint with validation and password encryption (BCrypt).
	- Configure Spring Security to allow registration without authentication.
	- Setup login (form login or JWT).
	- Implement CustomUserDetailsService to load users from DB.

Task 3: Student CRUD APIs
	- Implement CRUD endpoints for students with service and repository layers.
	- Add validation for student input data.
	- Secure endpoints so only authenticated users can access.

Task 4: Pagination, Sorting, and Filtering for Students
	- Add pagination and sorting support on GET /api/students.
	- Add filtering by name, enrollment date, etc.

Task 5: Role-based Access Control
	- Define roles (USER, ADMIN).
	- Restrict certain APIs (e.g., delete student) to ADMIN role only.

Task 6: Exception Handling and Validation
	- Implement global exception handler for consistent error responses.
	- Handle common exceptions like ResourceNotFound, DuplicateEmail, etc.

Task 7: Logging and Monitoring
	- Add logging for important events (user registration, student creation).
	- Add actuator endpoints for health and metrics.

Task 8: Testing
	- Write unit tests for services and controllers.
	- Write integration tests for APIs and security.

Task 9: Frontend Integration (Optional)
	- Create simple UI using Thymeleaf or React/Angular to interact with APIs.
